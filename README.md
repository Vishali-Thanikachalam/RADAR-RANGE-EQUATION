# Experiment 10: Evaluation of Radar Range Using Scilab
---

## Aim
To calculate the **maximum range of a radar system** using the **Radar Range Equation** and verify the results through **Scilab programming**.

---

## Theory
The **Radar Range Equation** is a key relationship used in radar system design to determine the maximum distance (**range**) at which a radar can detect a target.  

It is expressed as:

## Procedure

1. **Refer to the Algorithm** and write the Scilab code for the experiment.  
2. **Open Scilab** on your system.  
3. **Create a New Editor File:**  
   - Go to `File → New → Script`.  
4. **Type Your Code** in the editor window.  
5. **Save the File** with a suitable name (e.g., `radar_range.sce`).  
6. **Execute the Code:**  
   - Press **F5** or click **Execute → File with echo**.  
7. **If Any Errors Occur:**  
   - Review and correct the code.  
   - Save and **run it again** until it executes successfully.

## Result

Thus, the maximum range of a radar system calculated using the Radar Range Equation is successfully verified using Scilab programming.
